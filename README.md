# Restaurant Reviews App


## Project Overview

In this project I took a restaurant review web app with a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Steps to open and run the App

Follow the steps below for a quick way to run the app

1. Clone or download this git repository to your local machine

2. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, using the command terminal running Python 3.x you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000` or for a windows machine use `py -m http.server`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and experience what a mobile-ready website looks like even when network is offline.
